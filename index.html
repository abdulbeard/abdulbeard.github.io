	<h1>Welcome to my github website</h1>
	<p>I'm kinda excited I got this working. Checkout the 
		<a href="/blog" style="color:yellow">blog</a> 
		section for a glimpse into the past.</p>
	<p>The purpose of this site is really to serve as a sounding board for thoughts and ideas I have. Figured since I work as a
		software engineer, I should have a website where I can jot down thoughts and minutiae.
		Had a blast learning (and still am) learning about 
		<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" style="color:yellow">Jekyll</a>,
		<a href="https://pages.github.com/" style="color:yellow">Github Pages</a>
		 and

	<h1>What I do</h1>
	<p>
		As the lead software engineer on the "Core" team at NCR's Online Ordering team, I work on setting
		coding standards, while reducing technical debt. My team's job is to set standards for application 
		design and architecture. We also focus on writing code and libraries for our developers to consume.
		</p>
		<p>
		Examples of such libraries include:
		<br/>
		-  A wrapper for operating on a Redis cache through the use of 
		specially-decorated POCO objects.
		<br/>
		-  A simple library that provides the calling code the ability to log items to ElasticSearch with minimal
		blocking of the app's execution.

		 Some days I find myself knee-deep in custom powershell-jmeter-c# applications. We recently wrote
		 a load-test application that would would stress an api. This was done by leveraging powershell
		 remoting, Windows Performance Counters, JMeter test plans and a healthy dose of analysis of the
		 generated results. We used this to come up with a load-profile of our given stack, and to understand
		 our bottlenecks. We were also able to predict what kinds of server-configuration and footprint we'd 
		 need for upcoming, projected loads.
		 </p><p>
			 We have had the chance to use several tools to aid us in our mission. Jetbrains Resharper, DotTrace
			 and DotCover have been very helpful to us. Resharper helps set coding standards, naming conventions
			 and general code-health metrics and aesthetics. DotTrace helps us analyze performance bottlenecks,
			 inefficencies, and helps validate the value of our refactoring of the code.
			 DotCover has been monumental in helping us identify areas of poor unit-test coverage in our 
			 application, and really doing TestDrivenDevelopment.
		  </p><p>
		  Our application architecture is a fairly typical one, with a webserver layer, that communicates
		  with a layer of application servers, who in turn leverage a MSSQL database for persistence.
		  The webservers are light business-logic, light computation, and mostly presentation and application
		  flow. The appsevers do the heavy lifting i.e. 3rd party communication, business logic, data access
		  and persistence management.
		  One of our legacy features was the use of WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) betwen the website
		  and app servers. This was XML SOAP, not very customizable, and brittle with few people knowing 
		  how to fix/diagnose issues with it. I and my team championed our move off of this old, inefficient
		  technology, onto the sleek, fast WebApi in .NET. We were able to inject diagnostic headers,
		  use faster serialization and smaller payloads (Protobuf vs xml soap), and increase our throughput.
		  We ended up refactoring about 800+ instances of code usage, which helped us tremendously.
		  </p><p>
		   Sometimes, work means putting my who-broke-this hat on, and determining why some application
		    threads are deadlocking, or instead designing a thin, application-specific data-access
			 layer on top of a micro-ORM, like Dapper. 
			 Or sometimes it's just refactoring front-end assets to be served from a CDN instead, 
			 relieving application traffic by 75%. 
		My delightful days at work are identifying potential and existing problems, coming up with a solution, 
		rapid-prototyping to a minimal proof-of-concept and then debating pros and cons.
		My primary goal is learning more about application architecture and design first-hand, 
		and from other folks' wisdom and mistakes.
		I've been reading books on application architecture, and must say I'm fascinated and having fun.
