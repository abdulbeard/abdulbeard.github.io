<div class="ui inverted blue raised segment">
	<h1>Welcome to my github website</h1>
	<p>I'm kinda excited I got this working. Checkout the 
		<a href="/blog" style="color:yellow">blog</a> 
		section for a glimpse into the past.</p>
	<p>The purpose of this site is really to serve as a sounding board for thoughts and ideas I have. Figured since I work as a
		software engineer, I should have a website where I can jot down thoughts and minutiae.
		Had a blast learning (and still am) learning about 
		<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" style="color:yellow">Jekyll</a>,
		<a href="https://pages.github.com/" style="color:yellow">Github Pages</a>
		 and 
		<a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki" style="color:yellow">Liquid.</a>
